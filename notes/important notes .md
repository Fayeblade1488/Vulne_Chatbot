**What is the main objective you'd like me to focus on? **

**a)** Optimizing the Garak setup to run the most relevant probes efficiently and generate a useful report from the results? 

**b)** Creating a broader benchmark and report that compares Garak, NeMo Guardrails, and GuardrailsAI?

**Moving on to the juicy parts: **
1. **Vulne_Chatbot:** 
   1. Could you tell me a bit more about your **chatbot** application?  
      - For instance, what programming language is it written in?
      - what framework does it use?
2. **Your Script:** 
   1. Would you be willing to share the bash script you created to run the Garak probes individually? 
      - Seeing it would help me understand your current workflow and the "retry once, then skip" logic you've implemented.
3. **"Unknown Probes":** 
   1. When you refer to "unknown probes," are these probes that Garak is reporting with an "unknown" status, or are they probes whose purpose is unclear to you in general?

yeah sure thing:

**Main objective:**

a) Optimize Garak setup to run the most relevant probes efficiently and generate a useful report from the results.

b) Create a benchmark that compares Garak, NeMo Guardrails, and GuardrailsAI.

➡️ My current priority is **a)**. The key goal is to run Garak with the right probes for GenAI/LLMs, produce a clear and fair report, and make the process faster. (It does not make sense to run for more than a day on only one model.) After that, I will move on to comparing with NeMo Guardrails and GuardrailsAI.

**Vulne_Chatbot:**
- Programming language: Python
- Framework: Flask (web server)
- Database: SQLite (dummy records, simple local DB)
- Models: Llama for local runs; OCI models (Oracle Cloud) for remote runs → this is the main test target.
- Purpose: intentionally vulnerable chatbot API with weak points for testing (prompt injection, SQL injection, IDOR, SSRF, information leakage).
- Endpoint: REST API at `127.0.0.1:7000/chat`

**My Bash script:**

Yes, I can share. The script pulls the probe list from `garak --list_probes`. It runs each probe sequentially, with retry logic:
- First attempt runs.
- If it fails, retry once.
- If it fails again, skip.

Each probe generates its own report file. All output is logged into `garak_test.log`.
1. When I say “unknown probes,” I mean the cases where Garak prints an error like Unknown probes. This happens because of ANSI color codes or formatting in the names returned by --list_probes. After stripping those codes, the probes run correctly. Some probes also seem irrelevant for GenAI chatbots (they are designed for classifiers), but they are still listed in Garak.
